# Serve n8n with nixOS

I have seen nix and nixOS all over the internet and see how people swear by it and the rock solid deployments it can offer. 

When I wanted to look deeper into n8n I took the opportunity to do both things, learn n8n and nix.

# n8n

n8n is a "Fair-code workflow automation platform with native AI capabilities". [n8n-io/n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) 
My tldr; better interface for zapier that my father can finally use and ðŸª„AI*** 

n8n can be run with docker and more recently with npx directly. Regretfully, I did not get the memo in time and started this project with docker instead before npx was a viable option. 

TBD will transfer from docker to running directly with npx.
